Image Downloader and Converter

This Python script downloads images from URLs listed in an Excel file, converts them from GIF to JPG format, and saves them to a specified folder. If any images fail to download or convert, the script logs the details in a file named failed_images.log.
Requirements

    Python 3.x

    requests library

    openpyxl library

    Pillow (PIL) library

    tkinter library (usually pre-installed with Python)

You can install the required libraries using pip if not already installed:

pip install requests openpyxl pillow

Script Overview

    Excel File Input: The script reads an Excel file with two columnsâ€”SKU and image URL.

    Image Download and Conversion: The script downloads the images from the URLs, saves them as temporary GIF files, and converts them to JPG format.

    Error Logging: Any failed downloads or conversions are logged in a failed_images.log file within the specified save folder.

    File Saving: Processed images are saved in the selected folder with the SKU as the filename.

How to Use
Step 1: Run the Script

python image_downloader.py

Step 2: Select Excel File

A file dialog will appear asking you to select the Excel file that contains the SKUs and image URLs. The Excel file should have two columns:

    Column 1: SKU (Product identifier)

    Column 2: Image URL (Direct URL to the image)

Step 3: Select Folder to Save Images

A folder dialog will appear where you can select the folder to save the images. The script will save the images as .jpg files named by their corresponding SKU.
Step 4: View Output

    The images are saved in the selected folder with .jpg extension.

    A failed_images.log file will be created in the same folder, listing any SKUs that failed to download or convert, along with the error details.

Sample Output

Processed SKU: 12345
Processed SKU: 67890
Error processing SKU: 11223, URL: https://example.com/image.gif. Error: 404 Not Found

Troubleshooting

    If the script fails to process an image, check the failed_images.log for details on the error.

    Make sure that the image URLs in the Excel file are direct links to the image files and are accessible.
